**Foundation Working Group Committee Mid-Week Meeting**

- Seems like they're not going to have the CBRS radios in the places
  we're going to have them deployed. Will winding down 90% of the PoC
  rewards for existing CBRS radios incentivize them to pull off the
  network? Is that the intended result?

  - Why are we rewarding the ones that are already deployed if they
    don't add value to the network in the form of helping to close a
    CBRS deal with MNOs? Is there estimated long term value in keeping
    those CBRS nodes on the network?

- Don't want CBRS deployers to have the sentiment that they were on the
  gravy train and then all of a sudden aren't being rewarded enough for
  POC, so we need to be sure the taper down of PoC rewards is
  sufficiently gradual. The one proposed in the XIP seems to be
  acceptable.

- Support the June 1 target for wind down of PoC rewards for CBRS, as
  noted by Rich in WG Forum

Awarshauer

- Confirmed that we should wind down CBRS PoC rewards

- Do we need to update the XIP 11 document Rich's comments to ensure it
  enshrines the idea that we're not adding new CBRS nodes unless they
  qualify as the so-called Rural CBRS Pilot

- We need to clarify whether the CBRS PoC rewards need to come from the
  total emissions pool, or if it should be additive to the monthly
  allocation. For example, if one month's allocation of total rewards is
  5 million, and the calculated reward portion for CBRS nodes is 250k,
  does that add to the 5 million or just a part of?
