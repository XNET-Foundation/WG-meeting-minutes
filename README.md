## About 

> This branch is dedicated to housing the weekly meeting notes for the XNET Foundation Working Group. It is managed by the "Scribe" and serves as a living archive of our discussions, decisions, and action items. Each commit represents a snapshot of our weekly meetings, ensuring that all community members have transparent, versioned access to our progress. Please adhere to our contribution guidelines when updating this branch to maintain clarity and consistency.

## Objectives

The XNET Foundation Working Group mandate includes, but is not limited to:

* Promoting decentralization and community governance.  
* Evaluating and implementing strategies to enhance network security and prevent potential vulnerabilities.
* Collaborating with the community to shape balanced and innovative tokenomics oversight, ensuring the ecosystem’s long-term sustainability.
* Facilitating communication and collaboration between the XNET community of stakeholders and external partners, fostering partnerships and alliances that will contribute to the project’s overall growth.
* Conducting research and analysis to identify areas of improvement and innovation within the XNET ecosystem.

## Governance Process

The XIP submission outline is detailed in the #xip-forum channel in the XNET Discord. Proposals will be reviewed by the XNET Working Group prior to uploading to the Align platform to gauge community sentiment via thumbs up/down reactions. The final vote is cast by the Working Group members, requiring a quorum of at least 3 votes and 60% community approval to pass.

It is intended that the Working Group works and speaks on behalf of the community. As such, it is anticipated that a majority consensus of community sentiment in the form of thumbs up/down reaction shall not deviate materially from the final quorum voting of the working group.
